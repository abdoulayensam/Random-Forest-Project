Overview

This project provides an R script that demonstrates data analysis, visualization, and machine learning using a synthetic dataset. It includes:

Data Generation: A synthetic dataset with student information and preferences.

Data Visualization: Visual exploration using histograms, boxplots, and a correlation matrix.

Machine Learning: A Random Forest model is trained to classify students into learner types.

Example Plotting: Demonstrates creating a scatter plot using ggplot2.

Features

1. Data Generation

Creates a dataset with 250 observations.

Fields include demographic details, learning preferences, scores, and study times.

Saves the dataset as a CSV file.

2. Visualization

Generates histograms for numeric features.

Creates boxplots to compare scores by learner type.

Calculates and displays a correlation matrix.

3. Machine Learning

Implements a Random Forest classifier using randomForest.

Splits data into training and testing sets.

Provides model evaluation through a confusion matrix and accuracy score.

Displays feature importance using varImpPlot.

4. Example Plotting

Illustrates scatter plotting with the ggplot2 library.

Uses a small example dataset to plot categorized points.

Dependencies

The script requires the following R libraries:

dplyr: Data manipulation

ggplot2: Data visualization

caret: Model training

randomForest: Random Forest model

e1071: Utility functions for machine learning

readr: Reading and writing data

Instructions

To Run the Script

Ensure R is installed on your system.

Install the required libraries using the install.packages() function.

Run the script to:

Generate the dataset.

Visualize data distributions.

Train and evaluate a Random Forest model.

Predict the class for a new student instance.

Example Usage of Plotting Code

The included ggplot2 example demonstrates:

Creating a scatter plot.

Customizing themes and adding a legend.

Outputs

CSV File: apprenants_dataset.csv containing the generated dataset.

Plots: Visualizations for data analysis and exploration.

Model Evaluation: Console output for accuracy and confusion matrix.

Feature Importance Plot: Graph showing the importance of features in the Random Forest model.
